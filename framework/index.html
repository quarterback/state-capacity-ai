        <h2>Five Principles of Context Engineering Design</h2>
        <p class="lead">Context engineering isn't just about managing tokens and retrieval. It's about designing the systems AI models enter, the assumptions they carry, and the consequences they create.</p>

                    <h4>Context as Environment, Not Just Input</h4>
                    <p>Where is this system being deployed? What assumptions does it carry? What power does it hold? Context isn't just what's in the window—it's the environment the system enters.</p>

                    <h4>Disintermediation Analysis</h4>
                    <p>When does AI mediation separate people from relationships, capabilities, and decision-making? Not just "is the agent working?" but "is mediation helping or hurting?"</p>

                    <h4>System Accountability</h4>
                    <p>Who has to live with the outcome when the system gets it wrong? Not just "did the agent complete the task?" but "was the outcome right for the person?"</p>

                    <h4>Escalation & Refusal Design</h4>
                    <p>How do systems recognize their limits and know when to stop? Not just "can the agent handle edge cases?" but "can it admit when it can't?"</p>

                    <h4>Capability Preservation</h4>
                    <p>How do we ensure AI enhances rather than erodes human capability? Not just "is the interface intuitive?" but "are people learning or losing skills?"</p>
