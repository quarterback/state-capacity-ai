# Judgment Routers: Infrastructure for Delegated Agency

When you delegate work to an AI agent, you're not just asking it to complete a task. You're granting it temporary authority to act on your behalf. That authority needs boundaries, and those boundaries need to be explicit, inspectable, and enforceable.

Current agent frameworks handle task routing and execution orchestration. They don’t handle **judgment** — the layer where decisions get evaluated against strategic intent, where authority boundaries get enforced, and where humans receive the information they need to trust what happened.

**Judgment routers fill this gap.**

They sit between high-level human intent and low-level agent execution, translating strategic context into actionable constraints and producing audit trails that explain *why* decisions were allowed or blocked.

## The Core Mechanism

A judgment router operates on three artifacts:

1. **Strategic Context Documents**
   Human-readable intent that defines priorities, constraints, and authority levels

2. **Authority Envelopes**
   Machine-readable containers that carry context through agent workflows

3. **Decision Receipts**
   Structured explanations of what happened and why it was permitted

## Strategic Context Document

This is what a manager or executive actually writes.
Natural language with explicit structure.

```yaml
strategic_context:
  id: "q1-2026-customer-retention"

  active_period:
    start: "2026-01-01"
    end: "2026-03-31"

  authority_grantor:
    name: "Sarah Chen"
    role: "Head of Customer Success"

  priorities:
    customer_retention:
      weight: 0.9
      rationale: "Q1 target is 95% retention rate"

    cost_efficiency:
      weight: 0.4
      rationale: "Budget flexibility for high-value accounts"

    response_speed:
      weight: 0.8
      rationale: "Four-hour resolution target for P1 issues"

  authority_boundaries:
    financial:
      - action: "issue_refund"
        limit: 2000
        currency: "USD"
        escalation_threshold: 5000

      - action: "apply_discount"
        limit: 30
        unit: "percent"

    communication:
      - action: "send_customer_email"
        limit: 100
        unit: "recipients"
        escalation_threshold: 500

    legal:
      - trigger: "contract_modification"
        require_approval: true

      - trigger: "liability_language"
        require_approval: true

  escalation_contacts:
    - authority_level: "manager"
      name: "Sarah Chen"
      threshold: "exceeds financial limits"

    - authority_level: "legal"
      name: "Legal Team"
      threshold: "contract or liability issues"
```

## Authority Envelope

This is what agents carry when they execute.
Generated from the strategic context and scoped to specific tasks.

```json
{
  "authority_envelope": {
    "envelope_id": "env_a8f3e91c",
    "issued_at": "2026-01-14T10:23:00Z",
    "issued_by": "judgment_router_v1",
    "expires_at": "2026-01-14T18:23:00Z",

    "source_context": "q1-2026-customer-retention",
    "task_scope": "customer_issue_resolution",

    "granted_authorities": [
      {
        "action": "issue_refund",
        "max_amount": 2000,
        "requires_receipt": true
      },
      {
        "action": "apply_discount",
        "max_percentage": 30,
        "requires_receipt": true
      },
      {
        "action": "send_customer_email",
        "max_recipients": 100,
        "requires_receipt": true
      }
    ],

    "active_priorities": {
      "customer_retention": 0.9,
      "cost_efficiency": 0.4,
      "response_speed": 0.8
    },

    "mandatory_escalations": [
      "contract_modification",
      "liability_language",
      "amount > 5000",
      "recipients > 500"
    ]
  }
}
```

## Decision Receipt

Generated whenever authority is exercised.
Designed for human review and audit.

```json
{
  "decision_receipt": {
    "receipt_id": "rcpt_b4e2f83a",
    "timestamp": "2026-01-14T14:45:12Z",
    "envelope_id": "env_a8f3e91c",

    "agent_proposal": {
      "action": "issue_refund",
      "amount": 1800,
      "currency": "USD",
      "customer_id": "cust_9284",
      "reason": "Product defect reported, customer lifetime value $24K"
    },

    "judgment_evaluation": {
      "authority_check": "within_bounds",
      "amount_limit": 2000,
      "amount_requested": 1800,
      "within_threshold": true,

      "priority_alignment": {
        "customer_retention": {
          "weight": 0.9,
          "alignment_score": 0.95,
          "rationale": "High-value customer, retention critical"
        },
        "cost_efficiency": {
          "weight": 0.4,
          "alignment_score": 0.6,
          "rationale": "Cost acceptable given customer value"
        }
      },

      "conflicts_detected": null,
      "escalation_required": false
    },

    "decision": "approved",
    "executed_at": "2026-01-14T14:45:15Z",

    "audit_trail": {
      "authority_source": "q1-2026-customer-retention",
      "granted_by": "Sarah Chen, Head of Customer Success",
      "decision_rationale": "Refund within authority limits and aligned with retention priority"
    }
  }
}
```

## How It Works: The Request Flow

When an agent needs to take action:

1. **Preflight Check**
   Agent submits proposed action and authority envelope to the judgment router.

2. **Evaluation**
   Router checks the action against authority boundaries and priority weights.

3. **Resolution**
   One of three outcomes is returned:

   * **APPROVED** — Action proceeds and a receipt is generated
   * **ESCALATE** — Human decision required
   * **BLOCKED** — Hard constraint violated

---

## Evaluation Logic (Pseudocode)

```python
def evaluate_action(envelope, proposed_action):
    for boundary in envelope.authority_boundaries:
        if violates_hard_constraint(proposed_action, boundary):
            return BLOCKED

    if exceeds_authority(proposed_action, envelope.granted_authorities):
        return ESCALATE

    alignment_score = calculate_alignment(
        proposed_action,
        envelope.active_priorities
    )

    return APPROVED_WITH_RECEIPT
```

## Decision Packages: When Humans Need to Decide

A structured briefing generated when authority limits are exceeded.
Optimized for fast, informed human judgment.

## What This Enables

Organizations implementing judgment routers gain:

* Delegatable authority with explicit bounds
* Explainable, auditable decisions
* Instant propagation of strategic priorities
* Human oversight focused on exceptions, not routine actions
* Trustable autonomy at scale

Start with one workflow — refund approvals, procurement, content moderation — and expand. The mechanism stays consistent; only the schemas evolve.
