      <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
      <p>
        Across the world, the ability of governments to deliver essential services is uneven and contested.
        In some places, capacity is robust; in others, fragile or absent. Everywhere, it is under pressure.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yet conversations about state capacity often stay abstract, far from the operational realities that determine whether institutions can deliver what they promise.
        As confidence in public systems erodes, we need ways to see how competence and trust are built — and repaired — in practice.
      </p>

      <h2>What We Do</h2>
      <p>
        The State Capacity Project examines how governments and public institutions succeed or fail in execution.
        We study the mechanics of delivery — how policies become operations, and how operations sustain legitimacy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through research, case studies, and small experiments, the project shares what enables competent delivery and what causes breakdown.
        Our work is open, collaborative, and designed to help others build capacity from the inside out.
